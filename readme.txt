This repository contains scripts that are utilized by the UCLA 
Ground MAG SMART Project. Noise analysis scripts are used to 
evaluate GMAG sensor noise in the lab, and mid-range scripts 
form a system designed to run on Linux and power the new 
commercial-magnetometer system currently being developed.
